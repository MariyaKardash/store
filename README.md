# store

This repository was created for my programming course project.
The challenge was to write a client-server application in any programming language.
Of course, I chose JavaScript.

In this application, the BackEnd part is written in the Node.js. 
For the implementation of the FrontEnd, I chose Vanilla JavaScript.

This application implements all the functions of a regular online store - from choosing a product to ordering it.

It was a very interesting and rewarding experience.
